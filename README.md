# Week 3 Assignment

Hey folks! For this week, we're going to have you create a new GitHub repository/R Project that we'll be using for our in-class notes and work. This will mean we'll all be working on the same basic project structure, plus you'll be able to see each other's code on GitHub.

We'd like you to do the following things:

1) Clone this repository to your computer (just like we did for the last repository, so that it's an R Project as well)
2) Add the same folders as Martha outlined last class
3) Add an image to your images folder
4) Add an R script to your scripts folder, and name it "week_3_class_code"
5) Put an X in the box below, next to "Completed by student"
6) Commit all your changes and push them to GitHub

As always, let us know if you have any questions!
